<description>However in most cases we don't want the entire column to be returned to us, we want to find a certain user based on certain informations. Let's say you want to find the user with the email : john@gmail.com,</description> 
<description>we can do this easily with using a WHERE clause like this: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@gmail.com'; we can have multiple conditions like the following: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@gmail.com' AND password = '1234'; </description>

<description>Now the INSERT simply adds a new record into the table, for example with the previous table let's say we want to add a new user with the email : 'smith@gmail.com' and password '2345' we can do the following:</description>
          <description>INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ('smith@gmail.com', '2345')</description>
          
          <description>using the UPDATE command simply modifies an existing record in the table, for example with the record we just inserted into the table, let's change their email! UPDATE users SET email = 'new_smith@gmail.com' WHERE email = 'smith@gmail.com';</description>
          <description>UPDATE command requires us to give certain condtions in the WHERE clause to specify which record is to be updated.</description>
          
          <description>The DELETE allows us to delete a record from the table, for example with the record we just modified in table, let's delete the record: DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'new_smith@gmail.com';</description>
          <description>Just like the UPDATE command, DELETE requires us to give certain condtions in the WHERE clause to specify which record is to be deleted.</description>
