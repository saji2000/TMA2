<description>However in most cases we don't want the entire column to be returned to us, we want to find a certain user based on certain informations. Let's say you want to find the user with the email : john@gmail.com,</description> 
<description>we can do this easily with using a WHERE clause like this: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@gmail.com'; we can have multiple conditions like the following: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@gmail.com' AND password = '1234'; </description>
