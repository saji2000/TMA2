            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>In this project consisting of 2 parts we used different tools such as html, css, javascript, xml, MySQL and php to complete this project.</p>

            <p>In part 1, we implemented a fully functional bookmarking app which users can sign-up/login and input their favourite websites and store them there.
            Furthermore, they are able to edit/delete their bookmarks quite easily. Lastly, in the index.php page we show the most popular bookmarks in our web application!</p>

            <p>
              Part 2 was far more complex than part 1 due to the nature of content, in part 2, we were able to develop a simple Web Application with the purpose of
              Teaching people new to the programming with easy concepts and lessons about html, css, javascript, xml and ajax. It note worthy that we simply resused the teaching material
              that was written in Assignment 1. Our users are able to sign-up/login and view the available courses to select. Once selected they are able to view the lessons
              and to take a quiz to test their knowledge at the end.
            </p>
              
            <h2>Guide</h2>
            <p>All we need for this project is to have web browser and go the link: <a href="https://sajadassignment2.000webhostapp.com/TMA2/tma.htm">Here</a></p>
            <p>It sometimes says that it is unsafe but the other pages do not have the same problem. I believe the issue is with the hosting company 000webhost which was a simple and free one I chose for this project</p>
            <p>After entering, you can simply read the documentation tma.htm
               and are also able to navigate to part 1 and part 2 of this project thorugh the navigation bar at the top of the page</p>

            <h2>System Analysis and Design</h2>

            <h3>Part 1</h3>
            <p>In part 1 we mainly used php, html, css and MySQL for the sign-up/login process as well as for inserting, updating and deleting the bookmarks. 
              We also used Javascript to verify the website addresses. Two functions were used to verify the addresses that are isValidUrl() for checking the domain, url itself and isValidHttpUrl() to check for the https protocol
            </p>

            <p>For both Part 1 and Part 2 we used a quite similar code base in the each folder called db_connection.php that simply creates a new database, tables and inserts the values into the database. Lastly it provides a stable
              connection for us to communicate with the database through php! However, in our hosting server, they did not allow creating a new database or even tables from the db_connection.php file and therefore
              we had to simply copy paste the SQL command in database.sql (part 2)and db.sql (part 1) in the phpMyAdmin panel of the host.</p>
            
            <p>Again for both part 1 and part 2 sign-up/login were quite similar in their design as there was not much difference between the authentication system for both. Just a simple POST form and connection with the database and some simple php and SQL commands help us 
              authenticate the user quite easily.
            </p>
          
            <p>In part 2, we welcome the user in the index.php file and then ask them to sign-up/login, and then they are taken to the home.php page which has all the available courses for the student to select from and lastly the course is shown in course.php</p>
            <p>All the course contents are written in an XML format in the courses.xml file and the schema is in courses.xsd, a more detailed explanation of this is written in the next section.</p>

            <p>Simple parsing of this xml file is done using php XML parser, this is done in db_connection.php function populate_tables(). After being parsed the contents of the courses are inserted into the database in a simple format.</p>
