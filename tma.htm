            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>In this project consisting of 4 parts we used different tools such as html, css, javascript, xml, ajax to complete this project. 
              xml, xsl, xsd in part 1 and html, css, javascript in part 2 and html, css, javascript, ajax in part 3 and 4.</p>

            <h2>Analysis, Design and Documentation</h2>

            <p>In part 1 we mainly used xml and some css to create a personal resume. This part was relatively simple and straightforward, 
              containting only xml, xsl and xsd</p>

            <p>Part 2 was a web application that teaches basic concepts about tools that we have learned and used so far in this course and project. 
              We use javascript extensively in this project, mostly document.getElementById(id) and onclick function to get the elements and the manipulate them.
              Each unit is just a simple html, css in unit#.html same with quiz#html. But for quizzes we have individually implmeneted them in quiz#.js for that specific quiz!</p>
            
            <p>We implemented a slidewhow for part 3, this part was mainly focused on Javascript in slideshow.js since it was quite difficult task using event listeners, Ajax and Canvas. 
              Transitions were the hardest part, I started looking for a library in Canvas or even javascript, this proved to be the wrong approach.
              I simply used CSS transitions to solve this issue.</p>
          
            <p>The calculators in part 4 were relatively simple but a tedious part of the project, it consisted mostly of event listeners and simple calculations. Done in part4.js and par4_compute.js (for the conversion of measurements units) 
              For the third calculator I chose to use a bmi and bfp calculator for people to evaluate their health since we live in a day and age that obesity is widespread! </p>
              
            <h2>Guide</h2>
            <p>All we need for this project to have XAMPP and a browser, simply place the folder in the htdocs and then start running XAMPP through the application. 
              Lastly put the following url in your browser, http://localhost:8080/TMA1/tma.htm (for the localhost number it might be different according to your system)</p>
