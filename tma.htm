            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>In this project consisting of 2 parts we used different tools such as html, css, javascript, xml, MySQL and php to complete this project.</p>

            <p>In part 1, we implemented a fully functional bookmarking app which users can sign-up/login and input their favourite websites and store them there.
            Furthermore, they are able to edit/delete their bookmarks quite easily. Lastly, in the index.php page we show the most popular bookmarks in our web application!</p>

            <p>
              Part 2 was far more complex than part 1 due to the nature of content, in part 2, we were able to develop a simple Web Application with the purpose of
              Teaching people new to the programming with easy concepts and lessons about html, css, javascript, xml and ajax. It note worthy that we simply resused the teaching material
              that was written in Assignment 1. Our users are able to sign-up/login and view the available courses to select. Once selected they are able to view the lessons
              and to take a quiz to test their knowledge at the end.
            </p>
              
            <h2>Guide</h2>
            <p>All we need for this project is to have web browser and go the link: <a href="https://sajadassignment2.000webhostapp.com/TMA2/tma.htm">Here</a></p>
            <p>It sometimes says that it is unsafe but the other pages do not have the same problem. I believe the issue is with the hosting company 000webhost which was a simple and free one I chose for this project</p>
            <p>After entering, you can simply read the documentation tma.html and are also able to navigate to part 1 and part 2 of this project thorugh the navigation bar at the top of the page</p>

            <h2>Analysis, Design and Documentation</h2>

            <h3>Part 1</h3>
            <p>In part 1 we mainly used xml and some css to create a personal resume. This part was relatively simple and straightforward, 
              containting only xml, xsl and xsd</p>

            <p>Part 2 was a web application that teaches basic concepts about tools that we have learned and used so far in this course and project. 
              We use javascript extensively in this project, mostly document.getElementById(id) and onclick function to get the elements and the manipulate them.
              Each unit is just a simple html, css in unit#.html same with quiz#html. But for quizzes we have individually implmeneted them in quiz#.js for that specific quiz!</p>
            
            <p>We implemented a slidewhow for part 3, this part was mainly focused on Javascript in slideshow.js since it was quite difficult task using event listeners, Ajax and Canvas. 
              Transitions were the hardest part, I started looking for a library in Canvas or even javascript, this proved to be the wrong approach.
              I simply used CSS transitions to solve this issue.</p>
          
            <p>The calculators in part 4 were relatively simple but a tedious part of the project, it consisted mostly of event listeners and simple calculations. Done in part4.js and par4_compute.js (for the conversion of measurements units) 
              For the third calculator I chose to use a bmi and bfp calculator for people to evaluate their health since we live in a day and age that obesity is widespread! </p>
